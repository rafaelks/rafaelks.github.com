      <p>I'm working with Software Development since 2006 and writing iOS apps since 2010. I live in a tiny town in üáßüá∑, and I've been working remotely since 2011.</p>

      <p>I appreciate high-quality products that focus on stability and simple design that works great to the end user.</p>

      <p>I've created two digital companies in the past, both were very important for my personal development, but they didn't work out. Now I'm using all my learning from these experiences on my third one with my friend Thiago Sanchez. I started developing the idea in May 2018 after I realize organizing my trips was a mess, always having to move files around, search for tickets on my email, look for the hotel address in another application and there was still some application that didn't support offline state very well... so we looked around for solutions and decided to work on <a target="_blank" href="https://tripsy.app">Tripsy</a>.</p>

      <p>I don't have LinkedIn. üôÑ</p>

      <h2>üéì Education</h2>
      
      <p>
        <b>MBA in Management, Entrepreneurship and Marketing</b>
        <br /><b><a href="http://www.pucrs.br" target="_blank">PUCRS</a></b>
        <br />2019 ‚Äî 2020
        <br/ >Learning how to become a better leader, how to develop and market digital products and developing entrepreneurship skills with creators of great products.
      </p>        

      <p>
        <b>Bachelor of Information Systems</b>
        <br /><b><a href="https://www2.faccat.br/portal/" target="_blank">FACCAT</a></b>
        <br />2011 ‚Äî 2017
        <br />During my bachelor, I was able to study the fundamentals of computer science, system operations and the basics of software development. It was fundamental for me to create a solid knowledge on how software works.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>iOS Development</b>
        <br /><b><a href="http://www.bepid.com.br/poa/" target="_blank">Apple Developer Academy</a></b>
        <br />2013 ‚Äî 2014
        <br />This was one of the best experiences of my life. I took one year to fully study and understand the basic concepts of iOS development, frameworks and create my apps, games to learn more about the whole process. By the time I was studying at Apple Developer Academy, I already had about three years of iOS development experience, but I learned lots of new frameworks, new tools and things that are required other than coding to get an app ready to rock in the App Store.
