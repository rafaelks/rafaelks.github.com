      <h1>Rafael Kellermann Streit</h1>

      <p>I'm working with Software Development for about 12 years and currently writing iOS apps since 2010. I live in a very small town in Brazil and I've been working remotely since 2011.</p>

      <p>I appreciate high quality products that focus on stability and simple design that works great to the end user.</p>

      <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/rafaelks" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or write me an <a href="mailto:rafaelks@me.com">email</a>.</p>

      <h1>Education</h1>

      <p>
        <b>Bachelor of Information Systems</b>
        <br /><b>FACCAT - Faculdades Integradas de Taquara</b>
        <br />2011 — 2017

      <p>
        <b>iOS Development</b>
        <br /><b>Apple Developer Academy</b>
        <br />2013 — 2014
        <br />This was one of the best experiences of my life. I took one year to fully study and understand the basic concepts of iOS development, frameworks and create my own apps, games in order to learn more about the whole process. By the time I was studying at Apple Developer Academy I already had about 3 years of iOS development experience, but I learned lots of new frameworks, new tools and things that are required other than coding in order to get an app ready to rock in the App Store.
