      <p>I'm working with Software Development since 2006 and writing iOS apps since 2010. I live in a tiny town in Brazil, and I've been working remotely since 2011.</p>

      <p>I appreciate high-quality products that focus on stability and simple design that works great to the end user.</p>

      <p>I've started two digital companies in the past, both failed, and now I'm trying my third one with my friend Thiago Sanchez. I started developing the idea in May 2018 after I realize organizing my trips was a mess, later on, I invited Thiago to join me with his master skills on design and product development. I always had to move files around, search for tickets on my email, look for the hotel address in another application and there was still some application that didn't support offline state very well... so we started <a target="_blank" href="https://tripsy.app">Tripsy</a>.</p>

      <p>If you like to travel around, please make sure to download Tripsy <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/tripsy/id1429967544?mt=8">on the App Store</a> and give us the feedback of your usage, that would be important for us to create a great product.</p>

        <br />This was one of the best experiences of my life.

By the time I was studying at Apple Developer Academy, I already had about three years of iOS development experience, but I learned lots of new frameworks, new tools and things that are required other than coding to get an app ready to rock in the App Store.
